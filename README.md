# Project Resume

The goal of the project is to create a simple webapplication that features a Vue frontend and a .NET 3.1 API.

**Important:** This is a practice project to learn .NET Core and as a demo project for future contracts. Suggestions on how to improve are extremely appriciated.

Feature roadmap:

- [ ] List of projects (title, thumbnail, short description, used technologies)
- [ ] Tag system (one tag per technology) to be assigned to projects
- [ ] Filtering based on tags
- [ ] Custom markdown parsing to generate summarized list of functionalities per technology
	```markdown
